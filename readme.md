# X3P0 Progress

**WIP** block for outputting a `<progress>` element.

**Some notes:** I'm not 100% satisfied with using the core layout support for this.  This is especially true because I'd like to make it possible to also display the progress percentage above, below, and on the sides of the progress bar itself.  This is not currently implemented.  It will also likely take another wrapping `<div>` to do this.
