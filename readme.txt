A customizable progress bar block to visually track completion toward any percentage, numeric, financial, or unit-based goal.

== Description ==

X3P0: Progress is a block that allows users to create progress bars using a straightforward interface.

The block lets you add progress for nearly any type of goal:

- **Percentage:** Outputs a percentage from 0% to 100%.
- **Decimal:** Outputs a plain decimal number.
- **Currency:** Create financial progress bars, choosing from a list of worldwide currencies.
- **Unit:** Choose from a complete list of browser-supported units, such as yards, feet, liters, millimeters, and much more.

The output of the progress bar is highly customizable.  Aside from standard block options, such as spacing, alignment, and border control, users also have a range of design tools at their disposal.

This block outputs proper `<progress>` and `<label>` elements in the markup.  This should aid in accessibility, ensuring that all potential visitors to your site can read what the value of the progress is.
